<h1>Module Specs</h1>
<h3>Size Matters</h3>
<p>Our Modules are approximately 20% bigger than major competitors that offer a similar service.<br />
And even though you get more storage space with Mr Self Storage, our price is still competitive giving you better value for money.</p>

<p>Module Dimensions: Height 2.2m x Width 1.8m x Length 2.4m<br />
You can easily fit in large items like king size beds and mattresses, lounges and double door fridges.</p>

<h3>Hug a Tree</h3>
<p>Our Modules are environmentally friendly.<br />
They are constructed from 100% sustainable plantation timber.</p>

<h3>Good for your Goods</h3>
<p>When it comes to storage, timber is the preferred material in which to store your goods.</p>
<p>Timber is breathable and has good insulation.  These qualities lead to a natural climate control.  It is often described as the perfect storage environment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, metal storage units and containers do not have these qualities.  They can be prone to problems with condensation leading to drips and mildew.</p>

<h3>Safe n Sound</h3>
<p>Our Modules are weather proof.<br />
They are delivered with a watertight cover.<br />
You lock your Modules and will be the only person with the key.<br />
Storage is indoors within our secure and monitored storage facility.</p>
